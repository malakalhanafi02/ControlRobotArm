## ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites: Create a Catkin workspace

1. Source the ROS Noetic setup file:
```bash
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
```

2. Create and build a Catkin workspace:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/
catkin_make
```

3. Source the workspace:
```bash
source devel/setup.bash
```

4. Add the workspace to your .bashrc to source it automatically:
```bash
echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

## ü§ñ Clone the `arduino_robot_arm` Package

1. Navigate to the src folder of your workspace:

```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
 ```
2. Install Git if you haven't already:
```bash
sudo apt install git
 ```
3. Clone the arduino_robot_arm repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/smart-methods/arduino_robot_arm
 ```
4. Install Dependencies:
```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-moveit
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-joint-state-publisher ros-noetic-joint-state-publisher-gui
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-gazebo-ros-control joint-state-publisher
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-ros-controllers ros-noetic-ros-control
 ```
5. Compile the catkin workspace:
```bash
catkin_make
 ```
6. Verify Installation:
```bash
rospack list
 ```

Should look something like this when compiled successfully!

## üéÆ Control the motors and Visualize them in RViz

#### The following command will launch the RViz visualization tool and use the `joint_state_publisher` to control the joints of the robot:
```bash
roslaunch robot_arm_pkg check_motors.launch
```

#### The GUI allows you to control the joint states using sliders to adjust the angles of different joints, and you should see the robot model update in real-time:

#### To visualize the node graph and understand the communication between nodes, use the following command:
```bash
rqt_graph
```
#### This will open a window showing the nodes and topics in your ROS system:

#### To see the actual values being published to the `/joint_states topic`, use the following command:
```bash
rostopic echo /joint_states
```

## üëæ Launching the Simulation in Gazebo

#### The following command will launch Gazebo with the robot model and use the joint_state_publisher` to control the joints of the robot in the simulation:
```bash
roslaunch robot_arm_pkg check_motors_gazebo.launch
```

## üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Running the Python Script

#### The Python script `joint_states_to_gazebo.py` ensures that the joint states from the `joint_state_publisher` are properly communicated to the Gazebo simulation:
```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/arduino_robot_arm/robot_arm_pkg/scripts
sudo chmod +x joint_states_to_gazebo.py
rosrun robot_arm_pkg joint_states_to_gazebo.py
```

#### Running `rqt_graph` to show the connections between the nodes
